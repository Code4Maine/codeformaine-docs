Code 4 Maine 2014 Strategic Plan
================================

##Lessons from our Inaugural Year


Code for Maine was founded in 2012 as one of the original 8 groups participating in the brigade
program’s inaugural class. While most other brigades were centered around a single city, we
realized very early on that most of our participants were drawn from a broad region throughout
the state and that a regional effort would be necessary even if it made achievable goals much
more challenging. Likewise, we also understood that government partners in a region with the
oldest per-capita population would require significant education surrounding the benefits of
civic technology .

Our 2012-2013 Strategic Plan was therefore broadly focused on introducing the concept of
civic technology to public officials throughout the state, while also finding ways to augment
existing participatory traditions. In order to balance such broad goals with more achievable goals,
we also sought to partner with the cities of Biddeford and Bath, to demonstrate civic hacking in
action.

Far from being too ambitious, the results from our inaugural year could actually be interpreted
as showing our plan was not ambitious enough! Indeed, we found public officials eager to work
with us everywhere we presented, while our own membership blossomed to include a new
group of highly motivated and well organized civic hackers from the rural, northern portions of
the state.

Events including the National Day of Civic Hacking have proven to be an enormous success with
attendence in the city of Bangor alone matching that of far larger cities. Non-governmental
partners have included environmental organizations like the Friends of Casco Bay and local
libraries while local school districts and public charter school have eagerly embraced civic hacking
as part of the daytime curriculum.

These activities have been documented in detail in this [Year in Review Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11DM4zyMef7f0l0BxgHPrexVkznUoUz9EUWXtvgw7Wug/edit?usp=sharing).
Such unforeseen success, in concert with enormous growth in the parent program, has made it
clear that issues of capacity and organization will need to be addressed before anything more is
accomplished. Even in our original demonstration cities of Bath and Biddeford, the eagerness of
our city partners quickly surpassed our ability to organize talented hackers to meet their needs.
Whereas most of our original goals had been met by the end of 2013, it required almost the
whole of 2014 to reorganize into a stronger and more effective structure. Such a structure has
been built around the following core team members.


##Core Leadership Team

  * Andrew Jawitz, Co-Captain
  * Garrett Wilikin, Co-Captain

  * Jaime Smith , Community Organizer [Description](http://goo.gl/U1YJik)
 
##Strategy
As a regional brigade covering multiple independent communities we recognize the importance 
of building unifying network for which a national brand like CfA is uniquely suited. Such a network 
has the potential to promote collaboration across different communities as a more efficient  
means of using scarce public resources.  However, our experience has also proven that 
lasting campaigns require local, face to face events to sustain them. 
 
Therefore we have devised a two part strategy to balance our role as a nexus of regional 
collaboration with the potential to make a lasting impact in public sector life. 

### Municipal Partner - City of Bangor

In order to most effectively leverage resources in one area we will be prioritizing our 
relationship with the City of Bangor as our primary municipal partner with which to build an 
institutional presence and serve as a template for future partnerships.  

The Bangor program will meet regularly, establish its own specific goals and utilize the majority 
of brigade resources.   

The program will function as a pilot for future municipal partnerships through a detailed review 
of successes and failures of which a criteria for future partnerships will be based.   
 
####Annual Priorities

Build a core group of 20 members in the Bangor Municipal Partner Area.

Build at least two substantial municipal relationships in the Bangor MPA.

Deploy at least one marquee project in the Bangor MPA.

Create a working group and create a first draft of a document to help municipalities build public internet services.

### Regional Programs

To build on our role as a nexus of collaboration, we will also be highlighting scalable projects 
from around the state which may not be specific to a single city government but will draw heavily from the lessons learned in our first two years in order to build on the most successful outcomes.  

####Civic Making
 Many of the most successful projects that came out of our inaugural year combined tools and techniques of the DIY/Maker Movement with that of civic hacking into an approach we call "Civic Making". While such an approach is gaining in popularity all over the world, there are compelling reasons why it is especially suited to low density regions like Maine. Hacking with Hardware alongside Software encourages a broader range of partipants to contribute a diversity of skills and experise.  Also, the “DIY” methods promoted by the Maker Movement allow small communities to interact with civic software created for larger cities on an appropriate scale. Examples of this approach include an effort to make vehicle tracking hardware more affordable for small cities called the (OpenVehicleTracker[www.openvehicletracker.org]) and the (PaperMachine[https://github.com/Code4Maine/papermachine] which introduced techniques for building low-cost, DIY document scanners small town libraries, archives and municipal governments.

####Community Partnerships
  While our inaugural plan recognized the great potential for working with the many community partners in our region, we recognized that measurable outcomes would only come about after substantial effort was devoted to education and outreach.
   This year, we are able to identify partners who have already demonstrated a commitment to working with CfM.  These partnerships will form the core of our regional programming and as such have been selected for their regional influence.  

#####Educational Partners

  Educational partners include both primary public schools, such as the Harpswell Coastal Academy and higher education including Bowdoin College, Bates College, Colby College, UMaine Orono and Southern Maine Community College.

######Harpswell Coastal Academy-
   The Harpswell Coastal Academy is a public Charter School with a project-based curriculum that integrates standard academics into a focus on environmental research.  They have been actively working with Code for Maine on a planned community maker space that would be open to the public.  They are primary partners in Invasive Species and the Open Internet Access projects.

######CBBHacks (Colby, Bowdoin, Bates) 
http://www.cbbhacks.org/ Code for Maine has been invited to be a main presenter as an inaugural event bringing together hackers from Maine’s three private colleges, Bowdoin, Bates and Colby

######UMaine, Southern Maine Community College
  Unlike the private colleges which can bring enormous energy on a temporary basis, the public colleges have demonstrated longer term commitment to projects including Open Internet Access and Open Transit.

#####Environmental Organizations
######PublicLab
While Code for America has emerged as a powerhouse in the civic hacking world,the (Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science[www.publiclab.org])has emerged as a champion of a more hands-on, citizen-science oriented method of organizing with technology. Perhaps most significantly, they have perfected an effective means of documenting open source hardware projects for which many Code for Maine projects are already included at-http://publiclab.org/profile/ajawitz
  By partnering with PublicLab on specific projects such as the (ongoing effort to stem the disastrous impact of aquatic invasive species[http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/05-08-2014/mobilizing-data-to-combat-the-evil-green-crab]) we will bring expertise that helps government agencies, environmental NGOs and even local schools collect important data, both through the deployment of low-cost sensory techniques and by making larger open data sets more accessible through civic hacking.
  While a formal affiliation with PublicLab may not be necessary for the organization as a whole, Co-Captain, Andrew Jawitz will oversee the collaboration by serving on the Organizer Team within the PublicLab organization.
Another possible area of collaboration could be in utilizing the excellent (PublicLab "research note" network [http://publiclab.org/research/]) which has proven to be an effective means of documenting and soliciting help with open source hardware projects.


###Introducing [beehve](https://github.com/Code4Maine/beehve). A Project Management Dashboard for Remote Collaboration

Perhaps the most exciting project currently in development is the project management tool in of its own accord! Developed by Delivery Lead, Colin Powell, [beehve](https://github.com/Code4Maine/beehve) has been specifically designed to address challenges arising from regionwide organizing efforts wherein participation is likely to occur remotely. Beehve will facilitate a project pipeline that begins with a brainstorming hackpad, leads to a github repo,project wiki and ultimately top billing on the website while being managed by the Delivery Lead. Content displayed on the brigade landing page at http://www.codeformaine.org/ serves as a front end for the team dash, which will include everything from blog posts, to Meetup events to new contributions on our Github repository.

Outcomes
--------

Thanks largely to the success of two consecutive NDoCH events, the Bangor program is at 
such an advanced stage as to consider an Institution role for the Brigade.  Thus, a successful 
outcome in Bangor would meet the criteria of an Institutional model as currently defined by 
Brigade Leadership.  From the perspective of Code for Maine, the Bangor Program will be a 
success if/when it yields useful guidelines on which future municipal partnerships can be built. 

Success for campaigns will be based on the willingness of project partners to commit their own 
resources, adoption by other brigades and/or evolution into a self­sustaining civic startup.  

In addition to organizing NDoCH for the third year in a row we also plan to take part in other 
national events such as Code Across America and if possibly would like to organize a new 
event/conference.
